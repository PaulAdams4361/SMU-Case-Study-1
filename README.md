# SMU-Case-Study-1 ReadMe

### Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to keep track of activity associated to the SMU Case Study 1 group project.


### SMU-Case-Study-1 Folder Notes
1.  **ARCHIVE folder**:  Lists old R/RMD files that will not be presented to the grader.
2.  **DATA folder**: Contains the beer, brewery, and combined csv files used within our analysis.
3.  **DDS_CaseStudy1_FINAL.rmd file**: This is the final (ready-for-submission) rmd file.
4.  **DDS_CaseStudy1_FINAL.html file**: This is the final (ready-for-submission) html file.
5.  **Codebook.md**: Contains additional information on the variables created within our Final.rmd file.
6.  **README.md**: This is the current file containing helpful information regarding our group project.


### Analysis Notes
To complete the project, both Paul & Armando each coded a separate (R/RMD) file to address each question (See ARCHIVE folder).  The best code from each file was then chosen and placed within the FINAL.rmd file.
